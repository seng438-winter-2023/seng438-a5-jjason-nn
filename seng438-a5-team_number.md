# Introduction

In this lab, we used reliability assessment tools to look at integration test data. We did this by using two ways to look at failure data: reliability growth testing and the Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC). By changing the failure data, we were able to make models and charts that helped us figure out the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF), the number of failures, and how reliable the software was. The lab's main objective was to enhance our understanding of reliability analysis, measurement, and certification, as well as to establish when testing is necessary in software development. Moreover, we were exposed to the notion of failure data and its critical significance in avoiding future failures. The lab also helped to clarify our theoretical grasp of the relevance of reliability testing in software testing techniques. Lastly, we looked at tools that aid in the visualization and decision-making of failure data, such as reliability growth testing and RDC. Reliability growth testing required several tools and models to refine, analyze, and forecast data, while RDC created a visual and comprehensive graph for decision-making with fewer tools and models.
